The three little kittens, they lost their mittens,
And they began TO CRY,
"Oh, mother dear, we sadly fear,
That we have LOST OUR MITTENS."
"What!   Lost your mittens, you naughty kittens!
Then you shall have no pie."
"Meow, meow, MEOW."
"Then you shall have no pie."

The three little kittens, they found their mittens,
And they began To CRY,
"Oh, mother dear, see here, see here,
For we have FOUND OUR MITTENS."
"Put on your mittens, you silly kittens,
And you shall have some pie."
"Purr, purr, PURR,
Oh, let us have some pie."

There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile.
He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile.
He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,
And they all lived together in a little crooked house.

Ideally, I would like to receive a photograph of me!

Year 1
Receive Casper the friendly ghost as partner.
Cyan is a color.  Cinnamon is a spice.
It is fun to Croquet.

Year 2
Photographs you say.  Why photographs?
Graphical analysis is fun too.

Year 3
The cat in the hat roamed  around the world.
Here is a weird sentence.
We love to code
They fumed and fumed.  They laughed and laughed
Better a bird in the hand than two in the tree.


Year 4
That was interesting, indeed that was.
Would that we could always repeat an assignment
Earning money leaves a lot to be desired
Been there, done it, moved on
