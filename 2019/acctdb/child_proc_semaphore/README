Use the shell file 'run.sh' to execute 'acctdb' and the
'transaction_processor' because the PATH has to be set 
to "." so the correct transaction processor is executed.

Compile 'acctdb.c' as follows:
cc -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -o acctdb acctdb.c exitstat.c

This is because the include file <sys/ipc.h> requires _XOPEN_SOURCE
to be defined in order to compile with this fairly old version of GCC.
